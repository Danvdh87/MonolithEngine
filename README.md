# 2DGameEngine
# Oh no, not another game engine!
There are so many game engines out there already, why making another one?
First of all, it exists because I love coding! I had a couple of smaller 2D game ideas in my head and the possible choices of engines was narrowed down to Unity only.
The rest were either "too much" (like UE4) or not entirely cross-platform. When I was playing around with Unity, I quickly realized that
since I'm the type of person who rather goes to the source code than the documentation, this will not be my preferred choice, so I decided to code my own engine
with the feature set that I will actually use. During the first hours of the development, I already realized that for me, working on the engine is at least as fun as 
working on a specific game. I chose MonoGame framework to ensure that the engine cross-platform and low level enough for my needs.

Let me get this out of the way: I shared this engine with the public because I'd be happy to see other people use it, learn from it or maybe even help me to improve it, but this engine is not designed specifically for the public, but rather for myself to release my games with it. 
This means features will come according to my needs (or interests :) ) and changes might (and probably will) happen as the engine evolves.
